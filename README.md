# Software Design Fundamentals. Starting with Java.

## Softwares are computer-based-solution to a human-based-problem.
It's natural that a programmer gets to create software based solutions for real life problems. In order to solve a real life problem, you'd model the problem mathematically. In my opinion, computer technology is just an evolved form of mathematics; binary mathematics.

## Test what you claim: Unit tests
At a high level, when a task is given to a programmer, the programmer has to be deterministic of the input and output of the system he is going to create. In order to be deterministic that a system is doing what it is supposed to do, the programmer has to write unit tests in order to test the system.

### Divide and conquer at every level of abstraction: Subsystems
At every level of abstraction, the programmer's role is to divide the problem into simpler units. After dividing the problem in simpler units, the simpler units are solved and combined to create the solution of the problem that was divided. The later part is called integration.
